				<h4>My Skills</h4>
				<p class="special-paragraphs">My passion for programming has driven me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to grow and expand my skill set. Whether working on a personal project or collaborating with a team on a large-scale enterprise solution. As a programmer, I have developed a wide range of skills, which I will outline below. </p>
				<div class="container2-row">
					<div class="container2-columns">
						<h5>Java</h5>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">I had the opportunity to work on a large-scale project at Ericsson that utilized the latest Java technologies, including Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. The project's goal was to provide a consistent set of APIs to handle large amounts of data for other Ericsson applications. As part of the project team, my responsibilities included contributing to the development of the application, ensuring its scalability and efficiency, and collaborating with other team members to achieve project milestones. <br><br> Through my work on this project, I gained valuable experience in Java programming and modern development tools, as well as the ability to work on a complex project with a team of experts. The outcomes of the project were significant, resulting in improved efficiency and functionality for the Ericsson applications that relied on it. Overall, this experience highlighted my ability to deliver high-quality solutions to challenging problems and demonstrated my skills and experience in programming.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="container2-columns">
						<h5>Python</h5>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">During my tenure at Ericsson, my main responsibility was the development of tests for both new and existing functionalities within my assigned project. The primary objective of these tests was to ensure the continuous stability and reliability of the service being constructed. To achieve this, close collaboration with fellow developers was crucial to comprehend the project requirements, functional specifications, and use cases. <br><br> In the course of test development, I regularly executed the tests to promptly identify any potential issues or defects. Working hand-in-hand with the development team, I resolved these problems and ensured that the software functioned optimally and met expectations. Furthermore, I leveraged test automation tools and techniques to streamline the testing process and enhance efficiency. This experience provided me with invaluable skills in testing and quality assurance. It improved my ability to create and implement test plans, develop test cases, and automate testing procedures.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="container2-columns">
						<h5>Container Technology</h5>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">During my internship at Ericsson, I had the opportunity to gain extensive hands-on experience working with container-based deployments, which involved utilizing a range of cutting-edge technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Bash, and Git. These tools and frameworks enabled me to to develop skills in managing  complex software deployments, collaborating with fellow developers through the utilization of version control tools like Git, and automating deployment processes through the creation and implementation of efficient Bash scripts. <br><br> Through hands-on experience with these cutting-edge technologies, I not only gained a deep understanding of the challenges associated with containerization but also uncovered various opportunities it presents. The knowledge and skills I gained from this experience have provided me with a robust foundation in modern software development tools and techniques, which continue to serve as invaluable assets in my current role as a Java developer. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="container2-columns">
						<h5>Machine Learning</h5>
						<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout the course of my master's studies, I gained extensive experience and expertise in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. I applied this knowledge to a variety of projects, including ones where I collected substantial volumes of Twitter data using Twitter's API, which I then pre-processed using state-of-the-art natural language processing libraries. <br><br> To gain more comprehensive insights from the data, I utilized advanced statistical modelling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which enabled me to identify latent themes within the data and extract various topics from the tweets. By utilizing LDA topic modelling, I was able to uncover the underlying fundamental topics being discussed within the collection of tweets, providing me with a deeper understanding of the dataset. This project gave me an opportunity to hone my skills in machine learning and natural language processing, specifically in the context of Twitter data analysis, allowing me to develop a more comprehensive understanding of these fields.</p>

								<p>Investigating the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs</p>

							<div class="container5-columns-right">
								<p>In my research project I investigated the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs in near real-time. I collected a significant amount of Twitter data through Twitter’s API and pre-processed using natural language processing library. I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a statistical model to identify the latent themes in a collection of data to identify various topics from the tweets. Following the extraction of the topics using LDA topic modelling, it became clear which fundamental topics were being discussed in the collection of tweets. The findings of this research can also be used to highlight which groups of people require the most assistance.</p>

								<p>Autonomous IoT-based Sorting Machine</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/Misbah-Rizaee/IoT-Sorting-Machine-Project"><button class="container5-button">See the code &raquo;</button></a>
							</div>
							<div class="container5-columns-right">
								<p>In this project, we intended to prototype a sorting machine which is fully autonomous using IoT. This Project comprises a rotating conveyor belt. Its movement is executed using an ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller that pauses and resumes a DC motor attached to the belt. We have used the ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 Kit v1.3 which has a ESP- LyraP-CAM, which functioned as our main sensor, and an ESP32-S2-WROVER microcontroller, which we used to transmit the captured image of the packages to the cloud. We have also used an ultrasonic sensor to sense the arrival of a new package so we can pause the conveyor belt and let the cloud communication and colour detection happen.</p>

								<p>Predicting Fire Brigade Notional Price</p>
								<a href="https://github.com/Misbah-Rizaee/Machine-Learning-Project"><button class="container5-button">See the code &raquo;</button></a>
							</div>
							<div class="container5-columns-right">
								<p>London Fire Brigade is forced to allocate a large number of fire-fighters as well as pumps around London on a daily basis. This is a time-consuming process for the LFB1, as well as a real grapple for fire-fighters. In this project, we focused on working with the LFB's large dataset to understand what features might influence the price of such service and how the notional price could be predicted using a machine learning method that works best with our dataset. <br> We first began by cleaning the dataset. This process, involved removing some unnecessary records as well as selecting the most impactful features. We then applied some regression methods such as, Linear regression, svm, lasso, ridge and k-nearest neighbors to predict the price of fire brigade service. <br> Since the data pattern is linear, we noticed that, linear regressors are the most accurate predictors and they outperform other regressors. Therefore, the top three recommended methods are linear regression, svm and ridge regression respectively. <br> We discovered a number of ways that machine learning may increase awareness inside the organization and with a hope that it would help them make better decisions. It can be concluded that in such service, the number of hours in which the pump will be on directly determines the price. Although other features would impact the price, but Pump Hour Round Up will out shadow their effect.</p>
