						<h5>Investigating the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs</h5>
						<p>In my research project I investigated the potential of topic modelling on social media to support the identification of refugee needs in near real-time. I collected a significant amount of Twitter data through Twitter’s API and pre-processed using natural language processing library. I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which is a statistical model to identify the latent themes in a collection of data to identify various topics from the tweets. Following the extraction of the topics using LDA topic modelling, it became clear which fundamental topics were being discussed in the collection of tweets. The findings of this research can also be used to highlight which groups of people require the most assistance.</p>

						<h5>Autonomous IoT-based Sorting Machine</h5>
						<p>In this project, we intended to prototype a sorting machine which is fully autonomous using IoT. This Project comprises a rotating conveyor belt. Its movement is executed using an ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller that pauses and resumes a DC motor attached to the belt. We have used the ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 Kit v1.3 which has a ESP- LyraP-CAM, which functioned as our main sensor, and an ESP32-S2-WROVER microcontroller, which we used to transmit the captured image of the packages to the cloud. We have also used an ultrasonic sensor to sense the arrival of a new package so we can pause the conveyor belt and let the cloud communication and colour detection happen.</p>

						<h5>Predicting Fire Brigade Notional Price</h5>
						<p>London Fire Brigade is forced to allocate a large number of fire-fighters as well as pumps around London on a daily basis. This is a time-consuming process for the LFB1, as well as a real grapple for fire-fighters. In this project, we focused on working with the LFB's large dataset to understand what features might influence the price of such service and how the notional price could be predicted using a machine learning method that works best with our dataset. <br> We first began by cleaning the dataset. This process, involved removing some unnecessary records as well as selecting the most impactful features. We then applied some regression methods such as, Linear regression, svm, lasso, ridge and k-nearest neighbors to predict the price of fire brigade service. <br> Since the data pattern is linear, we noticed that, linear regressors are the most accurate predictors and they outperform other regressors. Therefore, the top three recommended methods are linear regression, svm and ridge regression respectively. <br> We discovered a number of ways that machine learning may increase awareness inside the organization and with a hope that it would help them make better decisions. It can be concluded that in such service, the number of hours in which the pump will be on directly determines the price. Although other features would impact the price, but Pump Hour Round Up will out shadow their effect.</p>
