    <h4>My Skills</h4>
    <p class="special-paragraphs">
        My passion for programming has driven me to constantly seek out new challenges and opportunities to grow 
        and expand my skill set. Whether working on a personal project or collaborating with a team on a large-scale 
        enterprise solution, I have developed a wide range of skills, which I will outline below.

        <!-- Java Skill -->
        <div class="container2-columns">
            <h5>Java</h5>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                I had the opportunity to work on a large-scale project at Ericsson that utilized the latest Java 
                technologies, including Spring Boot, Docker, and Kubernetes. The project's goal was to provide a 
                consistent set of APIs to handle large amounts of data for other Ericsson applications. This 
                experience highlighted my ability to deliver high-quality solutions to challenging problems and 
                demonstrated my skills and experience in programming.

        <!-- Golang Skill -->
        <div class="container2-columns">
            <h5>Golang</h5>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                I use Golang to build efficient, high-performance backend services, APIs, and microservices architectures. 
                Its concurrency model and simplicity allow me to develop scalable systems that handle heavy workloads with ease. 
                I have experience designing RESTful APIs, working with Go frameworks, and applying Goâ€™s native features to optimize 
                speed and reliability in production environments.                
            </p>

        <!-- Python Skill -->
        <div class="container2-columns">
            <h5>Python</h5>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Python is one of my core programming languages for backend development, scripting, automation, and AI/ML tasks. 
                I have utilized Python to automate deployment pipelines, process data efficiently, and implement machine learning models 
                in real-world applications. Its flexibility and extensive library ecosystem have enabled me to quickly build and deliver 
                robust, scalable solutions.                
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Terraform Skill -->
        <div class="container2-columns">
            <h5>Terraform</h5>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                I leverage Terraform to provision and manage cloud infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. 
                My experience includes writing reusable Terraform modules, automating the creation of AWS resources, and implementing 
                infrastructure automation strategies that increase reliability, consistency, and speed of cloud deployments across development 
                and production environments.
