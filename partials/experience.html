                At Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), I work as a Software Engineer specializing in cloud-native development 
                and infrastructure automation. My key responsibilities include enhancing cloud security, optimizing infrastructure 
                for scalability and reliability, and automating deployment pipelines across complex environments. I leverage technologies 
                such as Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, and CI/CD to build and manage scalable, secure systems supporting critical business 
                operations. My work involves implementing application-level security best practices, configuring infrastructure through code, 
                and orchestrating containerized applications with Kubernetes clusters. I have streamlined deployment workflows using platforms 
                like Morpheus and JFrog Artifactory, ensuring efficient artifact management and consistent application delivery. By focusing 
                on operational efficiency, resource utilization, and system reliability, I have contributed to improving the agility of cloud-based
                solutions. Collaboration, proactive problem-solving, and continuous improvement are at the heart of my contributions at HPE, where 
                I actively participate in Agile ceremonies and cross-functional initiatives to drive project success.

                During my internship at Ericsson, I contributed to the seamless deployment, optimization, and maintenance of microservices in 
                a cloud-native environment. Working primarily with Kubernetes, I deployed and monitored microservices to ensure optimal performance, 
                scalability, and fault tolerance. I supported maintenance activities by identifying, diagnosing, and resolving bugs, and implemented 
                enhancements in Java-based backend systems to improve service quality. A key part of my role involved conducting detailed code reviews 
                to maintain high coding standards, reduce technical debt, and support the delivery of robust, reliable software solutions. I actively 
                participated in Scrum ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, contributing to task prioritization, 
                estimation, and collaborative problem-solving within the Agile team. Through this experience, I developed strong technical and teamwork 
                skills, laying the foundation for my future contributions in large-scale software and cloud projects.
